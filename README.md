# reactive-cryptocurrencies-table
A simple table with short info about top cryptocurrencies written in TypeScript using React and Redux-Observables.

This is a small app just to tryout redux-observables.

## Start
In order to start the project:
* clone the repository
* install dependencies `npm install`
* create `.env` file with the following content:
```
API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
API_URL=https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data
```
This app uses [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/)  API so you'll have to register there and create your own API key. 
* Once it's done just type `npm start` in your console.
